### 3️⃣ Real-Time Railway Track Damage Detection  
**Owner: Vithanachchi N.Y – IT22285560**

- Low-cost **vibration (SW-420)** and **acoustic sensors** on tracks  
- Arduino-based data acquisition and anomaly detection  
- GSM module to notify control centres and train drivers if:
  - Cracks
  - Loose joints
  - Misalignment  
  are detected
- Designed to be **cheap, scalable and suitable for rural lines**

### 4️⃣ Data-Driven Accident & Blind-Spot Prediction  
**Owner: Pramodya W.S.C – IT22026170**
Collection of:
  - Real-time GPS data (speed, location)
  - IMU sensor data (acceleration, tilt, roll, yaw)
  - Track geometry information (curves, gradients)
  - Operational parameters (braking patterns, speed limits)
    
Machine-learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to:
  - Detect overspeeding on curves
  - Identify abnormal tilt angles and harsh braking events
  - Classify train operating conditions into Safe, Warning, and Dangerous levels

Risk scores are sent to the main system to:
  - Provide immediate audio-visual warnings to train operators
  - Log incidents for post-trip safety analysis
  - Support preventive safety actions and operational decision-making for Sri Lanka Railways

## 🔍 How the System Works (End-to-End Flow)

1. **Sense**
   - Sensors and cameras continuously monitor tracks, crossings and operating conditions.

2. **Detect**
   - Local algorithms detect anomalies:
     - Obstacles at crossings
     - Track vibration/sound patterns
     - Historical risk on specific segments

3. **Predict**
   - AI models calculate:
     - Probability of an accident
     - Time-to-collision (for trains near crossings)
     - Risk level of each track segment

4. **Alert & Act**
   - Automatic actions:
     - Close/open barriers
     - Trigger lights and sirens
   - Notifications:
     - SMS / app alerts to train drivers and control centres

5. **Learn & Improve**
   - New incidents and sensor readings are stored
   - Models are retrained to improve accuracy over time
